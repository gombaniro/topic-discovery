    "Natural language is messy, ambiguous and full of subjective interpretation, and sometimes trying to cleanse ambiguity reduces the language to an unnatural form. In this project, we experimented more about topic coherence, an intrinsic evaluation metric, and how we can use it to quantitatively justify the model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic Perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity as well is one of the intrinsic evaluation metric, and is widely used for language model evaluation. It captures how surprised a model is of new data it has not seen before, and is measured as the normalized log-likelihood of a held-out test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Focussing on the log-likelihood part, you can think of the perplexity metric as measuring how probable some new unseen data is given the model that was learned earlier. That is to say, how well does the model represent or reproduce the statistics of the held-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recent studies have shown that predictive likelihood (or equivalently, perplexity) and human judgment are often not correlated, and even sometimes slightly anti-correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optimizing for perplexity may not yield human interpretable topics*\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation of perplexity measure served as a motivation for more work trying to model the human judgment, and thus *Topic Coherence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of topic coherence combines a number of measures into a framework to evaluate the coherence between topics inferred by a model. But before that…\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topic coherence\n",
    "Topic Coherence measures score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. But,\n",

    "1. `C_v` measure is based on a sliding window, one-set segmentation of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity\n",
    "2. `C_p` is based on a sliding window, one-preceding segmentation of the top words and the confirmation measure of Fitelson's coherence\n",
    "3. `C_uci` measure is based on a sliding window and the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of all word pairs of the given top words\n",
    "4. `C_umass` is based on document cooccurrence counts, a one-preceding segmentation and a logarithmic conditional probability as confirmation measure\n",
    "5. `C_npmi` is an enhanced version of the C_uci coherence using the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI)\n",
    "6. `C_a` is based on a context window, a pairwise comparison of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity\n"

Next, we reviewed existing methods and scratched the surface of topic coherence, along with the available coherence measures. Then we built a default LDA model using Gensim implementation to establish the baseline coherence score and reviewed practical ways to optimize the LDA hyperparameters.\n",
