    "### Evaluate Topic Model in Python: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\\\n",
    "##### A step-by-step guide to building interpretable topic models\n",
    "\n",
    "** **\n",
    "*Preface: This article aims to provide consolidated information on the underlying topic and is not to be considered as the original work. The information and the code are repurposed through several online articles, research papers, books, and open-source code*\n",
    "** **\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/end-to-end-topic-modeling-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-35ce4ed6b3e0), I introduced the concept of topic modeling and walked through the code for developing your first topic model using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method in the python using Gensim implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pursuing on that understanding, in this article, we’ll go a few steps deeper by outlining the framework to quantitatively evaluate topic models through the measure of topic coherence and share the code template in python using Gensim implementation to allow for end-to-end model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why evaluate topic models?\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://tinyurl.com/y3xznjwq)\n",
    "\n",
    "We know probabilistic topic models, such as LDA, are popular tools for text analysis, providing both a predictive and latent topic representation of the corpus. However, there is a longstanding assumption that the latent space discovered by these models is generally meaningful and useful, and that evaluating such assumptions is challenging due to its unsupervised training process. Besides, there is a no-gold standard list of topics to compare against every corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is equally important to identify if a trained model is objectively good or bad, as well have an ability to compare different models/methods. To do so, one would require an objective measure for the quality. Traditionally, and still for many practical applications, to evaluate if “the correct thing” has been learned about the corpus, an implicit knowledge and “eyeballing” approaches are used. Ideally, we’d like to capture this information in a single metric that can be maximized, and compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at roughly what approaches are commonly used for the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eye Balling Models**\n",
    "- Top N words\n",
    "- Topics / Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "- Capturing model semantics\n",
    "- Topics interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human Judgements**\n",
    "- What is a topic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extrinsic Evaluation Metrics/Evaluation at task**\n",
    "- Is model good at performing predefined tasks, such as classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language is messy, ambiguous and full of subjective interpretation, and sometimes trying to cleanse ambiguity reduces the language to an unnatural form. In this article, we’ll explore more about topic coherence, an intrinsic evaluation metric, and how you can use it to quantitatively justify the model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Topic Coherence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we understand topic coherence, let’s briefly look at the perplexity measure. Perplexity as well is one of the intrinsic evaluation metric, and is widely used for language model evaluation. It captures how surprised a model is of new data it has not seen before, and is measured as the normalized log-likelihood of a held-out test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Focussing on the log-likelihood part, you can think of the perplexity metric as measuring how probable some new unseen data is given the model that was learned earlier. That is to say, how well does the model represent or reproduce the statistics of the held-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recent studies have shown that predictive likelihood (or equivalently, perplexity) and human judgment are often not correlated, and even sometimes slightly anti-correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optimizing for perplexity may not yield human interpretable topics*\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation of perplexity measure served as a motivation for more work trying to model the human judgment, and thus *Topic Coherence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of topic coherence combines a number of measures into a framework to evaluate the coherence between topics inferred by a model. But before that…\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is topic coherence?\n",
    "Topic Coherence measures score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is coherence?\n",
    "Topic Coherence measures score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. But …\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coherence Measures\n",
    "Let’s take quick look at different coherence measures, and how they are calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `C_v` measure is based on a sliding window, one-set segmentation of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity\n",
    "2. `C_p` is based on a sliding window, one-preceding segmentation of the top words and the confirmation measure of Fitelson's coherence\n",
    "3. `C_uci` measure is based on a sliding window and the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of all word pairs of the given top words\n",
    "4. `C_umass` is based on document cooccurrence counts, a one-preceding segmentation and a logarithmic conditional probability as confirmation measure\n",
    "5. `C_npmi` is an enhanced version of the C_uci coherence using the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI)\n",
    "6. `C_a` is based on a context window, a pairwise comparison of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "There is, of course, a lot more to the concept of topic model evaluation, and the coherence measure. However, keeping in mind the length, and purpose of this article, let’s apply these concepts into developing a model that is at least better than with the default parameters. Also, we’ll be re-purposing already available online pieces of code to support this exercise instead of re-inventing the wheel."

    "We started with understanding why evaluating the topic model is essential. Next, we reviewed existing methods and scratched the surface of topic coherence, along with the available coherence measures. Then we built a default LDA model using Gensim implementation to establish the baseline coherence score and reviewed practical ways to optimize the LDA hyperparameters.\n",
